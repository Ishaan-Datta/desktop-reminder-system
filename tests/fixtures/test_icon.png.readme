# This is a placeholder for the test icon.
# To use real icons, replace this file with a PNG image.
#
# You can use any 128x128 or 256x256 PNG image.
# Some suggestions:
# - Download free icons from https://www.flaticon.com/
# - Use emoji as PNG from https://emojipedia.org/
# - Create simple icons with GIMP or Inkscape
#
# For testing, the overlay will show a text fallback if
# the icon file is not found or is not a valid image.
